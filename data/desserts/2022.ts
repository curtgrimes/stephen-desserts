## Ingredients

### Cookies
**1 &frac14; cups** dry roasted peanuts, unsalted  
**&frac34; cup** all-purpose flour  
**1 tsp** baking soda  
**&frac12; tsp** salt  
**3 Tbsp** unsalted butter, melted  
**&frac12; cup** creamy peanut butter  
**&frac12; cup** granulated sugar  
**&frac12; cup** light brown sugar, packed  
**3 Tbsp** milk  
**1** large egg  

### Filling
**&frac34; cup** creamy peanut butter  
**3 Tbsp** unsalted butter  
**1 cup** powdered sugar  

## Directions

1. To make the cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Pulse peanuts in food processor until finely chopped, about 8 pulses. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk, and egg together in second bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture with rubber spatula until combined. Stir in peanuts until evenly distributed.
3. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon measure, place 12 mounds, evenly spaced, on the prepared baking sheet. Using a damp hand, flatten mounds until 2 inches in diameter.
4. Bake until deep golden brown and firm to touch, 15 to 18 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat portioning and baking remaining dough.
5. To make the filling, microwave peanut butter and butter until butter is melted and warm, about 40 seconds. Using rubber spatula, stir in powdered sugar until combined.
5. To assemble, place half the cookies upside down on work surface. Place 1 level tablespoon of the warm filling in the center of each cookie. Place an unflipped cookie on top of filling, right side up, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Allow filling to set for 1 hour before serving. Makes around 24 cookies.

## Ingredients

**2 &frac14; cups** all-purpose flour  
**1 tsp** baking soda  
**&frac14; tsp** salt  
**1 tsp** cinnamon  
**1 &frac34; tsp** ginger  
**1 tsp** allspice  
**&frac34; cup** butter  
**1 cup** dark brown sugar, packed  
**1** egg 
**1 tsp** vanilla extract  
**&frac14; cup** molasses  
**&frac14; cup** granulated sugar for rolling  

## Directions

1. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, all spice, and salt in a bowl and set aside.
2. Make your brown butter: melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. The butter will begin to foam. Make sure you whisk consistently during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan; continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma.
3. Immediately transfer the butter to a bowl to prevent burning. Set aside to cool for about 5 minutes.
4. With an electric mixer, mix the butter and brown sugar until thoroughly blended. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and molasses until smooth and creamy.
5. Add the dry ingredients slowly and beat on low-speed just until combined. Chill dough in fridge for about 15 minutes (this is to make the dough easier to roll into balls).
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grab a large tablespoon or so of dough and roll into a ball then roll in sugar. Place dough balls on cookie sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes.
7. Remove from oven and cool the cookies on sheets about 2 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining dough. Makes 20-22 cookies.
