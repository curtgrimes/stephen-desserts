## Ingredients

**Cookies:**  
**1 &frac14; cups** dry roasted peanuts, unsalted  
**&frac34; cup** all-purpose flour  
**1 tsp** baking soda  
**&frac12; tsp** salt  
**3 Tbsp** unsalted butter, melted  
**&frac12; cup** creamy peanut butter  
**&frac12; cup** granulated sugar  
**&frac12; cup** light brown sugar, packed  
**3 Tbsp** milk  
**1** large egg  

**Filling:**  
**&frac34; cup** creamy peanut butter  
**3 Tbsp** unsalted butter  
**1 cup** powdered sugar  

## Directions

1. To make the cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Pulse peanuts in food processor until finely chopped, about 8 pulses. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk, and egg together in second bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture with rubber spatula until combined. Stir in peanuts until evenly distributed.
3. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon measure, place 12 mounds, evenly spaced, on the prepared baking sheet. Using a damp hand, flatten mounds until 2 inches in diameter.
4. Bake until deep golden brown and firm to touch, 15 to 18 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat portioning and baking remaining dough.
5. To make the filling, microwave peanut butter and butter until butter is melted and warm, about 40 seconds. Using rubber spatula, stir in powdered sugar until combined.
5. To assemble, place half the cookies upside down on work surface. Place 1 level tablespoon of the warm filling in the center of each cookie. Place an unflipped cookie on top of filling, right side up, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Allow filling to set for 1 hour before serving. Makes around 24 cookies.

## Ingredients

**2 &frac14; cups** all-purpose flour  
**1 tsp** baking soda  
**&frac14; tsp** salt  
**1 tsp** cinnamon  
**1 &frac34; tsp** ginger  
**1 tsp** allspice  
**&frac34; cup** butter  
**1 cup** dark brown sugar, packed  
**1** egg  
**1 tsp** vanilla extract  
**&frac14; cup** molasses  
**&frac14; cup** granulated sugar for rolling  

## Directions

1. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, all spice, and salt in a bowl and set aside.
2. Make your brown butter: melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. The butter will begin to foam. Make sure you whisk consistently during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan; continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma.
3. Immediately transfer the butter to a bowl to prevent burning. Set aside to cool for about 5 minutes.
4. With an electric mixer, mix the butter and brown sugar until thoroughly blended. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and molasses until smooth and creamy.
5. Add the dry ingredients slowly and beat on low-speed just until combined. Chill dough in fridge for about 15 minutes (this is to make the dough easier to roll into balls).
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grab a large tablespoon or so of dough and roll into a ball then roll in sugar. Place dough balls on cookie sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes.
7. Remove from oven and cool the cookies on sheets about 2 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining dough. Makes 20-22 cookies.

## Ingredients

**Wet ingredients:**  
**6 Tbsp** butter, softened  
**&frac12; cup** granulated sugar  
Zest from 1 medium orange  
**1** egg, room temperature  
**1 tsp** vanilla extract  

**Dry ingredients:**  
**1 cup** all-purpose flour  
**&frac14; cup** unsweetened cocoa powder  
**1 tsp** baking powder  
**&frac14; tsp** salt  
**&frac12; tsp** cinnamon  
**&frac14; tsp** allspice  

**Icing:**  
**&frac12; cup** powdered sugar  
**1 Tbsp** fresh orange juice  
**1 tsp** orange zest  
**1 Tbsp** melted butter  
**1 Tbsp** cream cheese, softened  


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter, sugar and orange zest for 1 minute until well combined. Turn mixer to medium-low speed and add in egg (make sure it’s at room temp -- you can do this by running the egg under warm water for 1 min); beating until well combined. Next beat in the vanilla extract.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and allspice. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix together on medium-low speed until just combined.
4. Use hands to grab one heaping tablespoon full of dough and roll into a ball. Place on baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Slightly flatten cookies with the palm of your hand so they are about ¼ inch thick. (If you like very fat, puffy cookies, no need to flatten them at all.) Bake for 10-13 minutes until just barely golden brown on the edges.
5. Remove and allow to cool on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling completely. Repeat with remaining dough.
6. Once cookies have cooled, make the icing: add the powdered sugar, orange juice, zest, melted butter and softened cream cheese to a bowl. Spoon the icing onto the cookies or you can dip of the top of the cookies in the icing then place back on the wire rack to allow icing to harden. Makes about 14 cookies.

## Ingredients

**Cookies:**  
**&frac13; cup** granulated sugar  
**&frac14; cup** brown sugar, packed  
**&frac14; cup** honey  
**1 Tbsp** water  
**1 tsp** cinnamon  
**&frac34; tsp** ginger  
**&frac12; tsp** cardamom  
**&frac14; tsp** nutmeg  
**&frac14; tsp** allspice  
**&frac14; tsp** cloves  
**&frac18; tsp** cayenne pepper  
**&frac12; Tbsp** kosher salt  
**1 tsp** baking soda  
**2 Tbsp** heavy cream  
**1** large egg  
**2 &frac12; cups** all-purpose flour  

**Icing:**  
**3 cups** powdered sugar  
**3 Tbsp** lemon juice  


## Directions

1. Combine white and brown sugars in a saucepan with honey, water, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and cayenne pepper. Place over medium heat and whisk until the sugars dissolve and it just starts to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and let cool for 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Add salt, baking soda, heavy cream, and egg and whisk until thoroughly combined. Add flour and stir together with a wooden spoon until everything comes together as a dough.
3. Transfer dough to a piece of plastic wrap. Press into a ball and wrap tightly. Place in the refrigerator and let rest for 1 to 2 days.
4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Remove dough from the refrigerator and scoop into rounded teaspoons. Roll each one into a smooth ball if desired, and place on a prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cookies are perfectly dome-shaped with light golden brown bottoms, 9 to 10 minutes; don't overbake. Let cool on the pan all the way down to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.
7. While the cookies are cooling, repeat Steps 5 and 6 to shape and bake the remaining cookies.
8. Make icing by placing powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir in lemon juice, a few teaspoons at a time, until icing is very thick, but still slightly runny.
9. Dip the top of each cooled cookie into the icing. Let it drip, then flip it over and place on a wire rack set over a piece of parchment paper and let harden. Makes around 50 cookies.
