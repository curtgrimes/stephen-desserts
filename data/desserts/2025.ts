## Ingredients

**Dough:**  
**2 &frac34; cups** (344g) all-purpose flour  
**2 tsp** baking powder  
**&frac12; tsp** baking soda  
**&frac34; tsp** salt  
**&frac12; cup** (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature  
**1 &frac12; cups** (300g) granulated sugar  
**2** large eggs, at room temperature  
**10 oz** (283g) full-fat ricotta cheese, at room temperature (around 1 and 1/4 cups)    
**1 &frac12; Tbsp** fresh orange zest  
**1 Tbsp** fresh orange juice  
**&frac12; tsp** vanilla extract  
**1 cup** (180g) mini chocolate chips  

**Icing:**  
**1 &frac12; cups** (180g) confectioners’ sugar, sifted  
**3-4 Tbsp** fresh orange juice

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.  
2. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes.   
3. With the mixer running on low speed, add the eggs one at a time, then add the ricotta cheese, vanilla extract, orange zest, and orange juice. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.  
4. Add the dry ingredients and the chocolate chips. Beat on low speed just until incorporated. Do not over-mix. Dough will be very creamy, sticky, and thick.  
5. Cover dough tightly and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight and up to 2–3 days.  
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper.  
7. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Scoop 1 Tablespoon of dough for each cookie (20-23g each), using the Tbsp measuring spoon and a lightly floured finger to nudge the dough onto the baking sheet. Lightly flour your finger again and reshape each portion into a ball. Cookie size is important.  
8. Bake for 13–14 minutes, or until the top of a cookie springs back when lightly pressed with your finger. The cookies shouldn’t brown much at all.  
9. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely before glazing.  

**Make the Icing:**  
1. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and orange juice until smooth. Add an extra 1 or 2 teaspoons of juice to thin out, if needed. Spoon over the cookies.

## Ingredients

**Cookies:**  
**1 cup** (16 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature  
**&frac23; cup** (80g) confectioners’ sugar  
**1** egg yolk, at room temperature  
**1 tsp** vanilla extract  
**&frac12; tsp** peppermint extract  
**2 cups** (250g) all-purpose flour  
**&frac14; cup** (30g) cornstarch  
**1 tsp** baking powder  
**&frac14; tsp** salt  

**Buttercream:**  
**6 Tbsp** unsalted butter, softened  
**1 &frac12; cups** (180g) confectioners’ sugar  
**1-2 Tbsp** milk, at room temperature  
**&frac12; tsp** vanilla extract  
**&frac14; tsp** peppermint extract  
**1-2 drops** pink or red food coloring  

## Directions

1. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute.  
2. Add the confectioners’ sugar and beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed and beat for 2 full minutes, until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.  
3. Add the egg yolk, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract and beat on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.  
4. Add the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Beat on low speed until combined. The cookie dough will be thick and creamy.  
5. Cover dough and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days. Chilling is important for this creamy cookie dough.  
6. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.  
7. Scoop and roll dough into balls, about 1 Tablespoon or 20–22g each. Place dough balls 3 inches apart on the baking sheets, and then flatten each slightly with the palm of your hand; they should be just under 2 inches in diameter.  
8. Bake the cookies for 13–14 minutes or until the edges appear set. The cookies won’t darken/brown, so be careful not to over-bake them.
9. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.

**Make the buttercream:**  
1. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute.
2. Add the confectioners’ sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed and beat for 2 full minutes. To thicken the buttercream, beat in more confectioners’ sugar. To thin out the buttercream, beat in more milk.
3. Beat in 1 drop of food coloring. Add more to deepen the color, if desired.
4. Using a knife or icing spatula, spread frosting onto the cooled cookies.
