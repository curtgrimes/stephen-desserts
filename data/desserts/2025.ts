## Ingredients

**Dough:**  
**1 &frac12; cups** (188g) all-purpose flour  
**1 &frac12; tsp** baking powder  
**&frac14; tsp** salt  
**&frac12; cup** (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature  
**&frac34; cup** (150g) granulated sugar  
**1** large egg, at room temperature  
**1 tsp** vanilla extract  
**&frac12; cup** (80g) sprinkles 

## Directions

1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.  
2. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until creamed, about 1 minute.  
3. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. 
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Beat in 1/2 cup of sprinkles. Dough will be thick and sticky.
5. Scoop large sections of dough (about 2 Tablespoons of dough each) and roll into balls.  
6. Cover and chill the cookie dough balls in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (and up to 4 days).  
7. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.  
8. Arrange chilled cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft.  
9. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Ingredients

**Dough:**  
**2 &frac34; cups** (344g) all-purpose flour  
**2 tsp** baking powder  
**&frac12; tsp** baking soda  
**&frac34; tsp** salt  
**&frac12; cup** (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature  
**1 &frac12; cups** (300g) granulated sugar  
**2** large eggs, at room temperature  
**10 oz** (283g) full-fat ricotta cheese, at room temperature (around 1 and 1/4 cups)    
**1 &frac12; Tbsp** (135g) fresh orange zest  
**1 Tbsp** fresh orange juice  
**&frac12; tsp** (110g) vanilla extract  
**1 cup** (180g) mini chocolate chips  

**Icing:**  
**1 &frac12; cups** confectioners’ sugar, sifted  
**3-4 Tbsp** fresh orange juice

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.  
2. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes.   
3. With the mixer running on low speed, add the eggs one at a time, then add the ricotta cheese, vanilla extract, orange zest, and orange juice. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.  
4. Add the dry ingredients and the chocolate chips. Beat on low speed just until incorporated. Do not over-mix. Dough will be very creamy, sticky, and thick.  
5. Cover dough tightly and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight and up to 2–3 days.  
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper.  
7. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Scoop 1 Tablespoon of dough for each cookie (20-23g each), using the Tbsp measuring spoon and a lightly floured finger to nudge the dough onto the baking sheet. Lightly flour your finger again and reshape each portion into a ball. Cookie size is important.  
8. Bake for 13–14 minutes, or until the top of a cookie springs back when lightly pressed with your finger. The cookies shouldn’t brown much at all.  
9. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely before glazing.  

**Make the Icing:**  
1. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and orange juice until smooth. Add an extra 1 or 2 teaspoons of juice to thin out, if needed. Spoon over the cookies.

## Ingredients

3. In a large bowl, use a handheld or stand mixer with a whisk attachment to beat the egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract on high speed until creamy, thickened, and the sugar has mostly dissolved, about 4-5 minutes.  
4. Using a silicone spatula or mixer on medium speed, fold/beat in the coconut almond mixture until combined and evenly moistened. Dough will be wet and sticky.  
5. Using a medium cookie scoop or spoon, scoop 1.5 tablespoons of dough and place on prepared baking sheets, spacing them at least 3 inches apart.  
6. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown around the edges.  
7. Cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.  
8. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or microwave in 15-second increments, stirring after each, until smooth. Drizzle melted chocolate over cooled cookies. Let the chocolate set in the refrigerator or at room temperature.

## Ingredients

**Cookies:**  
**1 cup** (130g) salted pistachios*  
**1 cup** (16 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature  
**&frac34; cup** (90g) confectioners’ sugar  
**1 tsp** pure vanilla extract  
**1 tsp** almond extract  
**2 &frac14; cups** (281g) all-purpose flour  

**Brown Butter Icing:**  
**&frac14; cup** (4 Tbsp) unsalted butter  
**1 cup** (120g) confectioners’ sugar  
**2 Tbsp** milk  
**&frac14; tsp** pure vanilla extract 

## Directions

1. Pulse pistachios in a food processor until small crumbs form, yielding about 3/4 cup of finely chopped pistachios. Set aside.  
2. Beat the butter on medium speed in a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment for 1 minute until smooth and creamy.  
3. Add confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract, then beat on medium-high speed until fully combined.  
4. Add flour and 3/4 cup pistachio crumbs and beat until combined. The dough will be thick and may not come together immediately, but continue mixing.  
5. Cover the dough and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. (If chilling for 2+ hours, let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before rolling into balls.)  
6. Preheat oven to 350°F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.  
7. Roll dough into 1 Tablespoon balls and place them 1 inch apart on baking sheets.  
8. Bake for 14-15 minutes, until lightly browned on the bottom edges and just barely browned on top.  
9. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Let cool completely before icing.

**Brown Butter Icing:**  
1. Slice butter and place it in a small light-colored pot. Melt over medium heat, stirring occasionally.  
2. Once melted, the butter will foam. Stir for 5-6 minutes until the butter browns and a nutty aroma forms.  
3. Remove from heat immediately and let cool for 5 minutes.  
4. Whisk in confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Adjust consistency by adding more sugar for thickness or milk to thin it.  
5. Dip cookies into the icing or drizzle over the top. Icing will set in 1-2 hours if coated lightly.
